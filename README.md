# Look-for-Coins-Game
The program that receive an input from the command line indicating the locations of the coins and simulates a robot moving around in a 2-dimensional world, looking for coins. User can control robot step by step or choose the option to traverse entire world in order to find the coins.
Note: of course, traversing every cell in turn is not an optimal search strategy by any means, I'm working on adding the pathfinding algorithms to this program.
